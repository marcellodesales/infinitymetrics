<a href="../1/">Documentation from Milestone 1</a><BR><BR>

(work on Milestone 2 document together and produce one Milestone 2 document. 
No need for Milestone 2A document. Be sure to add at the end the organization and 
task allocation between global teams.
)
<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>Milestone 2 provides more detailed specs and requirements, with priorities. 
Milestone 2 specs are developed in more detail compared to Milestone 1 but 
they have to be consistent with Milestone 1, after you have incorporated 
instructors’ feedback. 
</p>

<p>
Basically, Milestone 2 has more details than Milestone 1 but it has to be 
consistent with it. It is also longer than Milestone 2 document – use as much 
space as you need but the expected length is about 20-25 pages.
</p>

Document Structure

<h4>Introduction:</h4>
<li>Repeat description of the final product from Milestone 1 updated for instructors’ 
comments (OK to copy it verbatim from Milestone 1, with feedback incorporated). 
<li>Come up with product or project name if you have not done so.

<h4>Use Cases</h4>
<li>Expand use cases as needed: stick to main use cases but give a bit more details 
about tasks, user skills, environment, error conditions etc. 
<li>Expected to cover 2-5 use cases,  appr. 1 page per each. For use cases you can use template or unstructured 
text. 
<li>For this year application be sure to cover use cases for system setup and 
configuration, teacher user case and student use case.

<h4>Functional Requirements and Specs</h4>
<li>Expand functional requirements and specs from Milestone 1 into Milestone 2, with more 
details (moving from only WHAT, to WHAT and a bit of HOW – you are slowly transitioning 
to design). 
<li>Keep related reference numbers wrt. Milestone 1 (i.e. if high level 
requirement was 3, then Milestone 2 more detailed requirements are 3.1, 3.2 etc.).  
Note that Milestone 2 specs and requirements have to be consistent (but with more details) 
with Milestone 1.
<BR>
<li>Prioritize each requirement/spec with 1, 2, 3. (1-must have; 2 – desired; 3 – opportunistic 
as defined in the class). To develop these priorities think of the user, use cases, and 
making your application complete from usability, marketing and business aspects. 
<li>Base this also on your skills, resources and schedules. Instructors will check final priorities. 
The priorities you set are your commitment (especially priorities of 1), so be very careful.
<li>Solidify and define key non-functional requirements such as speed, security, availability, 
browsers supported etc. (put some numbers and “tests” so they can be benchmarked and verified). 

<h4>UI Mockups and storyboards</h4>
<li>Expand mockups from Milestone 1. If you have not done mockups in Milestone 1 do them now. 
<li>Start with wire diagrams then add one more level of details in terms of layout, specific buttons, 
their functions, but not necessarily the colors and graphics yet. 
<li>Create simple “storyboards” by for example marking buttons as 1, 2, 3… then showing what happens
when button 2 is used in separate mockup. This helps test the navigation and flow. 
<li>Please do not add functions that are not specified in the requirements.

<BR><li>Briefly describe behavior of each function using text (user action, output, navigation, error 
conditions) 
<li>Stick with wire diagrams, do not use graphics yet (unless absolutely necessary), it 
draws attention from basic UI concepts (functions, behaviors, layouts, flow…). 
<li>Keep in mind ease of use and use cases, and use them to “test” the above mockups. 
<li>Do a walkthrough with your mockups as if they are “live”
<li>The format for UI mockups is very flexible: can use HTML, graphics tools, even hand drawings. 

<h4>High level Architecture and Database Organization</h4>

<li>Define architecture in the next level of details: main SW products used, main interfaces etc.
<li>Define any new APIs you propose, at high level of detail. 
<li>List all high level APIs and interfaces you know at this point (existing and proposed), and clearly 
mark those that you propose vs. core ones given to you.
<li>Describe the main file/data structure of Sonya’s files which you will use. 
<li>Describe the interfaces, APIs and methods to access these files and how will you store and use 
them in your system
<li>How will the database be organized? 
<li>Would raw content files (images, video, Word, JPG, PDF) be in the database or in the file system 
pointed to by the database? 
<li>Any special storage needs for anticipated size of the data
<li>Sketch the high level DB schema

<h4>High Level UML</h4>
<li>Provide high-level UML diagrams for implementation classes of core functionality, i.e. functionality 
with provided interfaces. Focus on a main high-level classes only.
<li>(View the UML tutorials in: https://ppm.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=0&expandFolder=0&folderID=9998)

<h4>Key Risks</h4>
<li>Identify key risks such as: 
<ul><li>skills (do you have the right skills), 
<li>schedule (can you make it given what you committed and the resources), 
<li>technical (any technical unknowns to solve), 
<li>legal/content (can you obtain content/SW you need legally with proper licensing, copyright). 
</ul>
<li>How do you plan to resolve risks? The key is to resolve risks as soon as possible

<h4>Team Organization</h4>
<li>Outline key roles of team members (as much as you know at this point). 
<li>For global groups: describe in one page max the organization and task allocation between global teams.
