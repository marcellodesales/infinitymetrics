5. COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS

Despite its wide range application, research on participation metrics of Java.net projects has yielded little significant contribution by the community at large. In fact, GlassFish, one of the largest and most widely used projects on Java.netWhile StatsWidgets provides the limited funtionality of outputting delimited text files of a given RSS feed (or a set of them), this implementation provides little usability for the intended audience of our system because it would require them to set up, configure and maintain a database to handle the outpu files generated by StatsWidgets. We aim to automate not only the retrieval of the RSS feeds, but the storage in a database that will enable presentation in meaningful and analytical ways to the user.
