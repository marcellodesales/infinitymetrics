Introduction

Software Engineering is one of the fastest growing fields today's global economy. This rapidly-evolving industry requires educational institutions to adopt innovative changes in their curriculums in order to provide students with the necessary competitive skills and experience required in today's job market. Precisely due to this globalization, more and more companies are developing software in virtual, distributed environments that trascend national and even international boundaries. As a consequence, educational institutions have instituted programs that simulate team software development in a controlled environment. This evolution in the pedagogy of Software Engineering, however, presents new challenges to instructors regarding student evaluation. It is therefore of paramount importance to provide instructors with the proper tools to assess team and individual progress, and to assess individual student participation within those teams in these new virtual classroom environments.

In lieu of these challenges, InfinityNet will provide cutting-edge and unique tools to instructors who choose the Java.net development platform as part of a Software Engineering class curriculum.  InfinityNet will allow instructors to monitor the participation of individual students in globally and/or locally distributed Java.net group projects as well as the progress of the team as a whole. InfiniftyNet will be an efficient, automated, and user-friendly web application that collects and reports student participation metrics for such class settings. The application allows an instructor or set of instructors in different locations (i.e. concurrent Software Engineering courses taking place in different universities) to automatically collect participation data for a set of Java.net projects and report on its members’ contribution to the project at all stages of development. InfinityNet is simplistic; the initial set-up will automatically generates the metrics categories available for the given projects, whilst allowing instructors to retain full control over modifying these at any point throughout the semester.

We believe that information is power. That’s why our system will provide instructors with the ability to collect and view a wide ranging variety of metrics from Java.net projects. It will also provide instructors with insightful information about trends and common difficulties that may arise in the development and learning processes. Our tool’s seamless integration with the Java.net platform, the valuable data it can extract & present (from granular to global), and its insignificant maintenance overhead will allow instructors to focus their efforts in the most important aspect of their task: teaching. InfinityNet will thus enable and improve the quality of learning for students by providing instructors with the tools needed to be heavily involved in the progress of the class and its individuals.
