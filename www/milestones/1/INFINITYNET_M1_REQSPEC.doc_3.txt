3.	HIGH-LEVEL System ARCHITECTURE
	

3.1.	Web Server and Web technology

		The "font-end" of the PPM implementation consists of an extensive User Interface, constructed mainly
	in PHP and perhaps Ajax.  This user interface will be two-tiered: Student Interface and Instructor interface.
	The student interface will be simplistic, authorizing valid java.net students to create, edit, and login to
	their respective accounts.  The Instructor user interface will be more complex in functionality.  This UI
	will be able to communicate with our Database Server, by requesting reports on team progress in a variety
	of output formats of choice.  Also, our PPM system will provide the instructors with the capability to 
	create a workspace, manage a workspace, and set-up a workspace in accordance with their specifications 
	and needs required by the term project.
