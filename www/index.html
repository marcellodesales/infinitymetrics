</div>
<p>
  <a name="Vision_(What_do_we_want_to_create?)"></a><strong>For Academia and the Industry</strong>, who require automated or semi-automated tools to collect metrics for teamwork assessment in collaborative <a name="Vision_(What_do_we_want_to_create?)"></a>software<a name="Vision_(What_do_we_want_to_create?)"></a> development environments such as Java.net, <strong>âˆžMetrics</strong> <strong>(Infinity Metrics) </strong> will be a web-based software that provides an online metric analysis interface to support project owners and managers. <strong>Unlike the prototype previously developed by <a target="_blank" href="https://statswidgets.dev.java.net/">Statwidgets</a></strong>, which neither properly parses XML documents nor uses a database for persisting the extracted data, <strong>PPM-8</strong> will efficiently collect metrics data from any Java.net public project and store them in a MySQL database to be later analyzed in web browsers.<br />
</p>
<div class="h2">
  <h2><font color="#ffffff">Background Information</font></h2>
</div>
<p>PPM-8 will be based on research findings from professors and professionals who identified the types of metrics that are useful for team assessment in collaborative software development. The information is described in the <a href="http://ppm.dev.java.net">PPM project</a>. It will be developed in PHP5, MySQL5 and use the most exciting AJAX interfaces.<br /></p>
<div class="h2">
    <h2><font color="#ffffff">Working Software Releases</font></h2>
</div>
<p>Use the ALM tabs above to navigate through our Agile development process. We will be using a set of User Stories on the Issue/Project Tracker to create our Product Backlog, and will be using short and incremental working releases deployed on a server. Links to the nightly builds will be also provided.<br /></p>
