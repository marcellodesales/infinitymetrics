Please refer to the video "<a href="/developer-corner/scrum.html#video_scrum_basic">Scrum Basic</a>" to understand about the terms that will be used
throughout the development of our solution. The process will be defined after our 
first general meeting (Milestone 1 Iteration Plan meeting).

<div class="h2"><h2><font color="white">Daily Activities</font></h2></div>
<ol>
	<li>Login to the IRC channel, Skype (when in meetings);</li>
	<li>Verify email box for activities, issues status changes, forum messages, etc;
		<ul>
			<li>Reply email messages for the team to the best of your knowledge;</li>
			<li>Issue status will give you a hint that an issue you needed has finished;</li>
			<li>Reply to forum messages whenever possible.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Pair-Programming whenever possible, over meeting at the university, over Skype, etc. Whenever possible use Remote Desktop;</li>
	<li>Verify the project calendar for any extra activity/meeting for the day and stay tuned!</li>
	<li>Access the Project Tracker page and look for the open tasks you're working on, or keep working on what you were before;
		<ul>
			<li>
				Since we are an agile team, pair programming will be used to develop features. Team pair peers have to
				organize themselves and solve the problem together. This will allow knowledge sharing and faster learning
				process.
			</li>
			<li>If there's any question regarding the issue, please use the comments section of each issue. It's a self-contained 
			place to discuss about the issue/feature, than having conversations across emails. Decisions are
			made and the ones responsible for the issue will be added to that.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<ul><li>After finishing a task/issue, please change the status to finished;</li>
		<li>Commit the code of the subversion repository, adding to the header of the commit message the issue ID number:<BR>
			<pre>
			(issue #2234) Creation of the class that validates the RSS feeds.
			- validation.class.php: the class that validates the RSS feeds;
			- utility.class.php: this class is used with utility functions, bla, bla...
			</pre>
		</li>
		<li>Copy the commit message response to the issue page comments:<BR>
			<pre>
			Committed revision 123.
			</pre>
		</li> 
		<li>QA/Team lead will review the issue;</li>
		<li>Verify that issue has is open for the current milestone;</li></ul>
	<li>If possible, attend the daily stand-up meeting;</li>
	<li>...</li>
</ol>

<div class="h2"><h2><font color="white">Documentation Activities</font></h2></div>
The team will be using Google Docs as the primary online documentation tool for the drafts. 
After a document has been finished, the final copy must be uploaded to the Document and Files
section. The link to the document must be provided into the ALM/Sprint Iteration section,
to the current Milestone/Sprint section. Go to the <a href"/meetings/">Meeting Channels</a> and review the section
"Document collaboration with Google Docs".
<BR>

<div class="h2"><h2><font color="white">Group Milestones (From prof's slides)</font></h2></div>
For the first four milestones M1-M4:
<ul>
	<li>Each announced in the class with detailed instructions posted (deliverables, schedule, format)‏
	<li>Groups develop milestone documents and submit to the instructors for review as per schedule by team lead
	<li>Instructors give official feedback on document hard copy
	<li>Students discuss in the group and with instructors and incorporate e-mail in the document, freeze it for final delivery. Keep the copy with instructors comments.
	<li>Use the previous milestone to develop the next milestone – have to be consistent
</ul>

<ul><li>Fifth milestone M5: final project demo and submission of all milestone documents, surveys, logs etc.
Class material will be synchronized with milestones.</li></ul>

<p>The drafts are going to be produced using Google Docs. Every team member has to 
participate on the discussions for the document.
</p>

<p>Students must submit each milestone document in TWO hard copies (to CS office) for the Group Milestone interaction, in requested format, on time, otherwise documents will be returned and considered not delivered on time
No on-line submissions. Hard copy will be used to write instructors comments on it and be returned to the group
Any delay in submission has to be approved by the instructor – team lead sends e-mail with the request for postponement before the milestone deadline
The more interaction, the better
</p>

<div class="h2"><h2><font color="white">Team Roles</font></h2></div>

<div class="h2"><h2><font color="white">Stand-up meeting</font></h2></div>
<p>The stand-up meetings are part of the agile process, and it is usually a team
status meeting. It is used to improve the commitment among the team members when
developing different features of the PPM software. It is a daily meeting that
is supposed to take only max 15-20 minutes, where each team member has to answer the
following questions:</p>
<table width="100%" border="0">
	<tbody>
		<tr class="b">
			<td style="width: 150px"><strong><a
				href="/meetings/"> What did I do yesterday or since last stand-up?</a></strong></td>
			<td>Basically you will communicate to the rest of the team what you did during the last day.
			This is an important tool to communicate to your team members you are working in progress
			to finish the code you are committed to do.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr class="a">
			<td style="width: 150px"><strong><a
				href="/servlets/ProjectNewsList"> What am I doing today?</a></strong></td>
			<td>You will give the next directions of your work during the day, even if it's continuing
			to work on the same thing the previous day, or to start coding something new, configuring the database, etc.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr class="b">
			<td style="width: 150px"><strong><a
				href="/servlets/ProjectMailingListList"> Is there anything blocking me?</a></strong></td>
			<td>This is another great opportunity to verify/clarify a problem you're having, if any. Whenever
			you have an impediment that makes you not progress in your development activities, you MUST
			communicate the team. Maybe a team member has had the same/similar problem before and he/she will
			be there to solve/mitigate the problem. This must be a problem that was not solved via email or other
			medium until before the stand-up meeting.</td>
		</tr>

<div class="h2"><h2><font color="white">Team communication</font></h2></div>

<p>Every developer has to be online in at least the IRC channel during their working
hours. Communication MUST be done in a transparent way, as any open-source tool.
The IRC channel is used as the main room to receive other users such as clients (professors),
etc. In this way, all members are required to hang out in the #ppm-8 channel at the Freenode.org server.</p>

<p>Whatever question you have to a person, you MUST make the question to the main
channel room, since this will promote collaborative learning. There are more chances
for someone in the room to answer your questions than just an specific person. For this reason, 
avoid contacting your peers through private IRC messages.</p>

<p>The meetings are conducted using DimDim.com tools. It's similar to the WebEx.com tools, 
an online conference tool mostly used by private enterprise companies. This includes remote desktop sharing
among the members for the team meetings whenever screen information is necessary. Please, 
make sure you have a microphone by your side ALL the time you're developing. It's FASTER 
to use voice communication for meeting purposes.  
</p>

From now on, all the information was collected from the presentations of the
main <a href="http://ppm.dev.java.net" target="ppm">PPM project</a>.

<div class="h2"><h2><font color="white">School-related tasks</font></h2></div>
All the development team members, who are from either SFSU or FAU, needs to fill-out the review
report, as part of the main research of our Distributed Software Engineering class.<BR>
Every Friday you must fill-out <a href="http://www.javelinfeedback.com/sun/index.jsp?pi=4b70710b87572f93e9b1caa5f7db593d" target="feedback">this feedback report</a>.

<div class="h2"><h2><font color="white">Teamwork</font></h2></div>
<ul><li>All group members must contribute to the best of their abilities;
<li>Participation in teamwork and group work, attending meetings and be courteous and responsible is a must;
<li>All group members get the same grade UNLESS the instructors are told or discover that somebody is not contributing fully. Those persons, if violations are verified,  may receive reduced grade
<li>Team lead or anybody: please report to instructor if group member is definitively not cooperating. Action will follow, mediation will be attempted first ….
<li>Success of SW projects is more correlated with team cohesion than sum of the quality of people
<li>Being a star in a team that does  not have good teamwork does not bring success
</ul>

In general, Teamwork is a set of capabilities necessary for today's software engineering success:

<ul>
<li>Knowledge and proper application of SE processes
<li>Knowledge of team organization and dynamics in SW development
<li>Proper personal team behavior: ethics, courtesy, attendance, being reachable and responsive
<li>Knowledge and proper application of SW development tools
<li>Knowledge and application of team collaborative tools
<li>MUST DO for students in this class
<li>Interaction and teamwork (inter-team, with instructors) is  the key and required . Poor or no interaction reduces the grade
<li>Content of the interaction of any class feedback (verbal, surveys, time cards) will NOT be graded and it is encouraged  please ask what you don’t understand and consult the instructors, there are no “bad” questions.
<li>Initiate interaction with instructors when you feel it is needed (verify specs etc.)  via e-mail, schedule meetings
<li>Grading is based not only on results but also on participation and interaction (subjectively determined by instructors)‏
</ul>

<div class="h2"><h2><font color="white">Assessment of progress</font></h2></div>
Both local and global groups have to do this – it is mandatory to fill in time cards.
Failure to submit time cards may result in up to 5% penalty in the grade
We will monitor the following issues related to Global SE and compare it with “classic” i.e. Local
Quality of delivered product
Resources, costs and efforts required to reach the deliverables (NOT used for grading)‏
Teamwork, group dynamics and user satisfaction or frustration with the process (NOT used for grading)‏
Factors that influence productivity of local vs. global groups: distance, time zone, lack of personal contact (NOT used for grading)‏
Time cards will be required weekly
Templates will be provided
