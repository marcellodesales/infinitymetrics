<h3>PPM-8 Agile/Scrum Development process</h3>

<h4>Daily Activities</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Login to the IRC channel, Skype (when in meetings);</li>
	<li>Verify email box for activities, issues status changes, forum messages, etc;
		<ul>
			<li>Reply email messages for the team to the best of your knowledge;</li>
			<li>Issue status will give you a hint that an issue you needed has finished;</li>
			<li>Reply to forum messages whenever possible.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Verify the project calendar for any extra activity/meeting for the day and stay tuned!</li>
	<li>Access the Project Tracker page and look for the open issues you're working on, or keep working on what you were before;
		<ul>
			<li>
				Since we are an agile team, pair programming will be used to develop features. Team pair peers have to
				organize themselves and solve the problem together. This will allow knowledge sharing and faster learning
				process.
			</li>
			<li>If there's any question regarding the issue, please use the comments section of each issue. It's a self-contained 
			place to discuss about the issue/feature, than having conversations across emails. Decisions are
			made and the ones responsible for the issue will be added to that.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<ul><li>After finishing a task/issue, please change the status to finished;</li>
		<li>Commit the code of the subversion repository, adding to the header of the commit message the issue ID number:<BR>
			<pre>
			(issue #2234) Creation of the class that validates the RSS feeds.
			- validation.class.php: the class that validades the RSS feeds;
			- utility.class.php: this class is used with utility functions, bla, bla...
			</pre>
		</li>
		<li>Copy the commit message response to the issue page comments:<BR>
			<pre>
			Code committed to revision 123.
			</pre>
		</li> 
		<li>QA/Team lead will review the issue;</li>
		<li>Verify that issue has is open for the current milestone;</li></ul>
	<li>If possible, attend the daily stand-up meeting;</li>
	<li>...</li>
</ol>

<h4>Group Milestones</h4>
For the first four milestones M1-M4:
<ul>
<li>Each announced in the class with detailed instructions posted (deliverables, schedule, format)‏
<li>Groups develop milestone documents and submit to the instructors for review as per schedule by team lead
<li>Instructors give official feedback on document hard copy
<li>Students discuss in the group and with instructors and incorporate e-mail in the document, freeze it for final delivery. Keep the copy with instructors comments.
<li>Use the previous milestone to develop the next milestone – have to be consistent
</ul>

<ul><li>Fifth milestone M5: final project demo and submission of all milestone documents, surveys, logs etc.
Class material will be synchronized with milestones.</li></ul>

The drafts are going to be produced using Google Docs. Every team member has to participate on the discussions
for the document. 
<BR><BR>
Students must submit each milestone document in TWO hard copies (to CS office) for the Group Milestone interaction, in requested format, on time, otherwise documents will be returned and considered not delivered on time
No on-line submissions. Hard copy will be used to write instructors comments on it and be returned to the group
Any delay in submission has to be approved by the instructor – team lead sends e-mail with the request for postponement before the milestone deadline
The more interaction, the better

<h4>Team Roles</h4>
Everyone is a team Developer, including the Team Leader. This last one will be responsible 

<h4>Stand-up meeting</h4>
<p>The stand-up meetings are part of the agile process, and it is usually a team
status meeting. It is used to improve the commitment among the team members when
developing different features of the PPM software. It is a daily meeting that
is supposed to take only max 15-20 minutes, where each team member has to answer the
following questions:</p>
<table width="100%" border="0">
	<tbody>
		<tr class="b">
			<td style="width: 150px"><strong><a
				href="/meetings/"> What did I do yesterday or since last stand-up?</a></strong></td>
			<td>Basically you will communicate to the rest of the team what you did during the last day.
			This is an important tool to communicate to your team members you are working in progress
			to finish the code you are committed to do.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr class="a">
			<td style="width: 150px"><strong><a
				href="/servlets/ProjectNewsList"> What am I doing today?</a></strong></td>
			<td>You will give the next directions of your work during the day, even if it's continuing
			to work on the same thing the previous day, or to start coding something new, configuring the database, etc.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr class="b">
			<td style="width: 150px"><strong><a
				href="/servlets/ProjectMailingListList"> Is there anything blocking me?</a></strong></td>
			<td>This is another great opportunity to verify/clarify a problem you're having, if any. Whenever
			you have an impediment that makes you not progress in your development activities, you MUST
			communicate the team. Maybe a team member has had the same/similar problem before and he/she will
			be there to solve/mitigate the problem. This must be a problem that was not solved via email or other
			medium until before the stand-up meeting.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h4>Team communication</h4>

<p>Every developer has to be online in at least the IRC channel during their working
hours. Communication MUST be done in a transparent way, as any open-source tool.
The IRC channel is used as the main room to receive other users such as clients (professors),
etc. In this way, all members are required to hang out in the #ppm-8 channel at the Freenode.org server.</p>

<p>Whatever question you have to a person, you MUST make the question to the main
channel room, since this will promote collaborative learning. There are more chances
for someone in the room to answer your questions than just an specific person. For this reason, 
avoid contacting your peers through private IRC messages.</p>

<p>The meetings are conducted using DimDim.com tools. It's similar to the WebEx.com tools, 
an online conference tool mostly used by private enterprise companies. This includes remote desktop sharing
among the members for the team meetings whenever screen information is necessary. Please, 
make sure you have a microphone by your side ALL the time you're developing. It's FASTER 
to use voice communication for meeting purposes.  
</p>

<h4>School-related tasks</h4>
All the development team members, who are from either SFSU or FAU, needs to fill-out the review
report, as part of the main research of our Distributed Software Engineering class.<BR>
Every Friday you must fill-out <a href="http://www.javelinfeedback.com/sun/index.jsp?pi=4b70710b87572f93e9b1caa5f7db593d" target="feedback">this feedback report</a>.
