	<div class="h2"><h2>PPM-8 Virtualized Environment</h2></div>
	
	In order to maintain a single image of the development environment, the team 
	will optionally be using a VirtualBox image with the entire installation
	of the necessary software to develop. VirtualBox is a free virtualization 
	tool provided by Sun to the community! More information go to 
	<a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" target="virt">http://www.virtualbox.org/</a>. 
	The PPM-8 virtualization image includes the entire infrastructure discussed on 
	the PPM project during the <a href="https://ppm.dev.java.net/servlets/ForumMessageList?forumID=3238">Milestone 0</a>.
	  
	<ul>
		<li>Windows XP SP3;</li>
		<li>Apache 2.2, PHP 5.2.4, xdebug 2.0.3, MySQL 5, Netbeans 6.5;</li>
		<li>CollabNet Subversion 1.5, Tortoise Subversion Plug-in;</li>
		<li>Additional software for development such as TOAD (MySQL designer) and others.</li>
	</ul>
	
	In real-world projects, virtualization became a de-facto standard in customizing
	development builds for the entire team. In fact, developers only work in virtualized
	machines instead of their own when it comes to bigger enterprises. As a consequence, 
	every developer will be working with the same environment profile for development 
	activities and will be able to make easier references to their peers accordingly. 
	Moreover, operations technicians will promptly make one single update to the 
	environment and every one with the same virtual machine profile will be with their 
	development environment updated.
	<BR><BR>
	For our PPM-8 development environment, we will be updating the profile once we have
	a big change with the softwares necessary to develop out application.<BR>
	
	<div class="h2"><h2>PPM-8 Windows XP LAMP Development Profile 001</h2></div>
	
	This profile is a fresh Windows XP SP3 installation, so no unnecessary softwares
	were installed. The only necessary changes to this environment is to checkout the
	project files from the PPM-8 Subversion repository.
	<BR><BR>
	The download is located at ftp.ppm-8.marcellosales.com (usr, pwd)=(u39758270-ppm8, 51527981).
	Once you are logged in to the FTP server, download the file ppm-8.virutalbox.lamp.1.0.0.tar.gz. 
	You can extract the contents of this file using Winzip under Windows.
	
	<ol>
		<li>Download VirtualBox for your host operating system (the system you have in your own computer. See <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Screenshots" target="scr">screenshots</a>.) <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" target="virt">http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads</a>; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkP8m4xusuw" target="inst>See a video with installation steps</a>.</li>
		<li>After installation, unzip the contents of ppm-8.virutalbox.lamp.1.0.0.tar.gz into the same
		root directory of the VirtualBox installation. That will replace the main xml file, and add 2 directories
		with the definition of the LAMP machine and the images;</li>
		<li>Follow instructions in how to start VirtualBox and bring the virtual box up;</li>
		<li>Once on Windows XP, open the Windows Explorer (useful shortcuts on the bottom bar) and
		navigate to the C:\ppm8-dev directory;</li>
		<li>Right-click in the empty space and select <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/image/tid/13">Tortoise SVN</a> Checkout to checkout the ppm-8 
		project from our project;</li>	
	</ol>
	
	Tortoise SVN is an optional SVN client that makes life easier
	by navigating through Windows Explorer. <BR><BR>
	
	With this setup, everyone will have the same configuration files that will be checked in 
	into the subversion repository. Additionally, we will be sharing the same copy of the development 
	environment.
