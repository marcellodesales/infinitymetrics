∞Metrics: Automatic Collaboration Metrics for java.net Projects

Description
------

Infinity Metrics is a distributed collaboration Software Engineering project between students from San Francisco State University (SFSU) and Florida Atlantic University (FAU). Our project corresponds to Group 8 of the Project Participation Metrics project, or PPM. The project aims to create a web-based application that will enable instructors teaching Software Engineering courses with distributed global development teams using the java.net platform to collect and track student participation. To read more about our project please visit its java.net project space.

Infinity Metrics aggregates data from Java.net and provide reports for all types of users. In addition to that, we provide customized visibility for instructors and students participation metrics for such class environment mainly via the projects' syndicated RSS feeds on java.net. The application allows a single instructor or set of instructors in different locations (i.e. concurrent Software Engineering courses taking place in different universities) to automatically collect participation data for a set of java.net projects and report on its members’ contribution to the project at all stages of development.
We aim to provide an intuitive, easy-to-use application that requires little initial set-up and will automatically generate the metrics categories available for the given projects, whilst allowing instructors to retain full control to modify these settings at any point throughout the semester.

Status
-----

This project was terminated at the time the students graduated from SFSU and FAU, although the server still runs. Java.net discontinued its service.

Previous location
